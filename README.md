### Image Super-Resolution
Image super-resolution is a technique used in digital image processing to enhance the resolution of an image, thereby increasing its clarity and details. This is particularly useful for processing low-resolution or blurry images.

### Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)
The SRCNN is designed to improve the resolution of low-resolution images, producing high-resolution versions. By leveraging deep learning techniques, SRCNN effectively enhances image quality, making it a valuable tool in various applications such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, and more.
